# SmartCabAllocationSystem

This Smart Cab Allocation System is created in C++ and has the following modules:

i). Admin SignUp/Login
  The admin signup and login takes in input for the admin and also allocates the cab attributes to the associated cabs.
ii). Employee Signup/Login
  The employees can avail the services of the cab. The Allocation system chooses the cab nearest to the employee to reduce  the distrance travelled.
iii). The allocation system
  The allocation system returns the id of the cab alloted and also the distance from the employee.


Scope of Improvement:
  i). Store and fetch real time data for the cabs and also the employee availing the service.
        This data includes the location and availability of the cabs as well as the location of the employee.
  ii). Help employee track the real time location of the cabs that are currently in use.
  iii). Use of an efficient GPS API to get accurate location details.
